        This method detects the dialect of the CSV file using the specified
        detection method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample : str
            A sample of text from the CSV file. For best results and if time
            allows, use the entire contents of the CSV file as the sample.

        delimiters : Optional[Iterable[str]]
            Set of delimiters to consider for dialect detection. The potential
            dialects will be constructed by analyzing the sample and these
            delimiters. If omitted, the set of potential delimiters will be
            constructed from the sample.

        verbose : bool
            Enable verbose mode.

        method : Union[DetectionMethod, str]
            The method to use for dialect detection. Possible values are
            :class:`DetectionMethod` instances or strings that can be cast to
            as such an enum.

        skip : bool
            Whether to skip potential dialects that have too low a pattern
            score in the consistency detection. See
            :func:`ConsistencyDetector.compute_consistency_scores` for more
            details.

        logger : Optional[logging.Logger]
            A logger object to log messages. Active only when verbose is True.
            If None, messages are printed to stdout.

        Returns
        -------
        dialect : Optional[SimpleDialect]
            The detected dialect. Can be `None` if dialect detection was
            inconclusive.
